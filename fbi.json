On July 4, 1981, David's dismembered remains began to be discovered in and along the Snake River six miles west of Clarkston, Washington, in an area just west of Silcott Island. Some, but not all, of the remains were recovered elsewhere along the river the next day. The remains had been concealed inside black plastic bags\u00a0and some of the body parts were wrapped in pages from various April 1981 editions of the local newspaper. David\u2019s blue 10-speed bicycle, clothing, and other personal items were never recovered.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Early in the investigation, multiple individuals traveling Highway 95 on the day of David\u2019s disappearance reported seeing a female cyclist matching David\u2019s description being approached by a man driving a brown van on the west, or southbound, side of the highway just outside Genesee, Idaho. Additional reports suggest the same man also spoke with or approached different female cyclists or pedestrians along Highway 95 the same day.\u00a0</p>",

To persuade the women to participate, Pratt\u00a0and his co-conspirators\u00a0allegedly convinced the women they would remain anonymous, that their videos\u00a0\u200bwould be provided to private collectors on DVD,\u00a0and would not be posted on the Internet.\u00a0Pratt\u00a0allegedly paid other young women working at his direction to act as references or provide false assurances to the women that, if they filmed a video, the video would not be posted online.\u00a0Some\u00a0\u200bwomen\u00a0were not permitted to leave the shooting locations until the videos were made\u00a0\u200band\u00a0\u200bothers\u00a0were allegedly forced to perform certain sex acts they had declined to do. Allegedly, some of the women were sexually assaulted.\u00a0 \u200bPratt's pornography websites\u00a0generated more than $17 million U.S. dollars in revenue.\u00a0 A federal arrest warrant was issued for Pratt in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, on November 6, 2019.\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
